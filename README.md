 # Lab 01 — Environment Setup & Git Workflow
 ## Tasks- [x] Install Node LTS, Git, VS Code- [x] Configure Git user and default branch- [x] Initialize repo and create semantic `index.html`- [x] Create `.gitignore` and `README.md`- [x] Open a Pull Request from a feature branch
 ## How to run
 Open `index.html` in a browser (or use VS Code Live Server).
 ## Screenshots
 1) PR page  2) DevTools → Network tab (HTML request shows 200)
 ## Reflection (100–150 words)- What is an HTTP request/response?- Which status code did you see, and what does it mean?- One thing you learned about Git today.
